# My Task Manager

A simple Task Manager project built as a learning exercise to improve my skills in TypeScript, Express, and React. This project is designed with a focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD), small incremental steps, and clear code structure. It uses an in-memory data store for simplicity, allowing for quick rebuilds and focused learning without the complexity of a database.

## Why This Project?

- **Learning:** Reinforce programming fundamentals, especially in TypeScript and TDD.
- **Practice:** Build and rebuild a project using a kata-style approach.
- **Simplicity:** Keep things lean and focused on core concepts before integrating more complex tools.
